# work-tracker ( a web-app based on MERN stack and Redux )
(open to use and modify)

It's very common situation that you have dependencies with other teammates in a project. But it's always very confusing to keep track of all your dependencies and work together. You have to follow up with your teammates about the status via mails or other contacts. That's too tiring! isn't?

Well this is a web app created to tackle those problems. To be precise, it's like Jira(an application for issues and bugs tracking ) but a mini version of that.

I recommend you to go to "About" section to see the full details of almost all the features to get clear idea about the app. And while you are already there why not just check the application.
Use following credentials to login:

username: user.new

PIN: 0000

Following are the features which make this web-app an efficient work manager:

1) Only Registered users can login to use this app.
   -> well you might be thinking that ofcourse we have to register to log into the app but there is a deal... Only your Admin has access to create your login details ( in work scenarios, Admin is usually the project manager).
   
2) Login via 4 digit PIN.
  -> that's an another relief, as you don't have to create passwords and type them everytime. Just create a 4 digit PIN of your choice and login instantly.

3) one look Dashboard.
  -> Dashboard has all the information that you need to know, All the tasks submitted by you to your teammates, all the tasks assigned to you by your teammates and also a form to add a task.
  -> Dashboard has a beautiful layout of 3 column grid to display your information in a nice way.

4) tasks in a Card layout.
  -> All the information of the tasks are arranged beautifully in a Card structure, so that you can see every major details of the task at one glance.
  -> Contents of the card:

     2) Task Date: the date and time when task was assigned to you
     3) Task Status: status of the task whether it is open, pending, closed or anything else
     4) Assigned/Submitter's name: Submitted task card displays the name of the person you have submitted your task to, while in Assigned task card the person who assigned you the task his name is shown.
     5) Description: You can see the details of the task here.
     6) Actions: these has two options, change the status or re-assign the task to someone else if it's not yours. You also get a "Delete task" option in the top right corner of the card to delete the task.

5) Add Task form.
  -> a simple form to assign a task to your teammates, mentioning all the major details including priority of the task.

6) Floating Menu button at the bottom right of the dashboard.
  -> Contains two options, to logout from your page and change PIN if you want.
  
7) Universal Search Bar at the top.
  -> you can search almost anything regarding the tasks. You can search on the basis of assignee name, status, task title, task description etc.

8) Tasks' sorting functionality.
  -> When you login to the page, all the tasks are always sorted from old to new, so that you can focus on completing old tasks first. But no problem if you wanna work on latest or more priority tasks. Just choose the options and there you go.
